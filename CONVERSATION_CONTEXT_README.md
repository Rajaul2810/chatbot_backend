# Conversation Context Implementation

## Overview
The chat service now supports conversation context, allowing the chatbot to understand follow-up questions and maintain context throughout a conversation.

## How It Works

### Backend Changes
1. **Modified `chatService.js`**: Now properly handles conversation history by including previous messages in the OpenAI API call
2. **Updated `chatController.js`**: Added validation for previousMessages format and debugging logs
3. **System Prompts**: Enhanced with contextual understanding instructions
4. **Added Test Endpoint**: `/api/chat/test-context` for testing conversation context
5. **Format Conversion**: Automatically converts frontend message formats to backend format

### Frontend Implementation

#### Supported Data Formats
The `previousMessages` can be sent in either of these formats:

**Format 1 (Frontend Style):**
```javascript
const previousMessages = [
  {
    text: "Tell me about BBA course",
    sender: "user"
  },
  {
    text: "BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is a 4-year undergraduate program...",
    sender: "Mentors"
  },
  {
    text: "What's the price?",
    sender: "user"
  }
];
```

**Format 2 (Backend Style):**
```javascript
const previousMessages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Tell me about BBA course"
  },
  {
    role: "assistant", 
    content: "BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is a 4-year undergraduate program..."
  },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "What's the price?"
  }
];
```

#### API Call Example
```javascript
const chatRequest = {
  message: "What's the schedule?",
  category: "Course & Mock Info",
  previousMessages: [
    {
      text: "Tell me about BBA course",
      sender: "user"
    },
    {
      text: "BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is a 4-year undergraduate program...",
      sender: "Mentors"
    },
    {
      text: "What's the price?",
      sender: "user"
    },
    {
      text: "The BBA course fee is 45,000 BDT per semester...",
      sender: "Mentors"
    }
  ]
};

fetch('/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(chatRequest)
});
```

## Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Course Information
```
User: "Tell me about BBA course"
Assistant: "BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) is a 4-year undergraduate program that covers business fundamentals, management principles, and practical skills. It's perfect for students interested in business careers."

User: "What's the price?"
Assistant: "The BBA course fee is 45,000 BDT per semester. Total program cost is 360,000 BDT for 4 years (8 semesters)."

User: "When does the next batch start?"
Assistant: "The next BBA batch starts on January 15th, 2024. Classes are held Monday to Thursday from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM."
```

### Example 2: Study Abroad
```
User: "Tell me about studying in Canada"
Assistant: "Canada offers excellent education with affordable costs compared to other countries. Popular programs include Business, Engineering, and Computer Science."

User: "What about the cost?"
Assistant: "For studying in Canada, you'll need approximately 20,000-30,000 CAD per year for tuition, plus 15,000-20,000 CAD for living expenses."

User: "What are the requirements?"
Assistant: "For Canadian universities, you'll need IELTS 6.5+ overall, 12th grade completion with 70%+ marks, and proof of funds (around 25,000 CAD)."
```

## Key Features

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The bot understands follow-up questions like "price?", "schedule?", "requirements?" based on previous conversation
2. **Message History**: Maintains up to 10 recent messages to prevent token overflow
3. **Validation**: Backend validates message format before processing
4. **Bilingual Support**: Works with both Bangla and English conversations
5. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging to troubleshoot issues
6. **Format Flexibility**: Supports both frontend and backend message formats

## Implementation Notes

- The system automatically limits conversation history to the last 10 messages
- Messages must have either `text`/`sender` or `role`/`content` properties
- The bot will provide contextual responses even for short follow-up questions
- Works across all categories (Course Info, Study Abroad, Technical Support, etc.)
- Automatically converts frontend format to backend format

## Testing

### Manual Testing
To test the conversation context:

1. Send an initial question about a specific topic
2. Send follow-up questions like "price?", "schedule?", "requirements?"
3. Verify the bot maintains context and provides relevant information
4. Test with both English and Bangla/Banglish conversations

### Automated Testing
Use the test endpoint to verify conversation context:

```bash
GET /api/chat/test-context
```

This endpoint simulates the exact conversation you mentioned:
- User: "MBA course details"
- Assistant: [Provides MBA course details]
- User: "price koto?"
- Expected: Should provide MBA course price specifically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot asks "which course?" instead of providing context**
   - Check if `previousMessages` are being sent correctly
   - Verify message format (text/sender or role/content properties)
   - Check server logs for debugging information

2. **No conversation context maintained**
   - Ensure frontend is sending `previousMessages` array
   - Check if messages are in correct format
   - Verify the conversation history is being passed

3. **Debug Information**
   - Check server console logs for:
     - `=== CHAT REQUEST DEBUG ===`
     - `=== CONVERSATION CONTEXT DEBUG ===`
     - `=== FINAL MESSAGES TO OPENAI ===`

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Frontend**: Ensure `previousMessages` is being sent in the request
2. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for debug information in server console
3. **Test Endpoint**: Use `/api/chat/test-context` to verify functionality
4. **Message Format**: Ensure each message has either `text`/`sender` or `role`/`content` properties

### Expected Log Output
```
